Timezone Converter - Android Studio project (modern UI)
======================================================

What this contains:
- A complete Android Studio project skeleton (Kotlin) using Material components.
- MainActivity implements date/time pickers and timezone conversion using SimpleDateFormat + TimeZone.
- UI layout uses ConstraintLayout with Material look.

How to build APK (recommended):
1. Install Android Studio (latest stable).
2. Open this folder in Android Studio (choose 'Open' and select the project root).
3. Let Gradle sync/download dependencies.
4. Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
5. Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s).
6. After build completes, you'll get the APK path in the Build output. Transfer/install to your phone.

If you want me to produce a signed APK, I can provide detailed instructions to sign the APK locally or guide you through the process.
